## About Me 

Full-stack engineer with 9+ years transforming technical requirements into production systems. My expertise spans server-side development, native mobile applications, and cloud infrastructure—with a focus on writing maintainable code that scales.

**Core Focus Areas:**

**Server-Side Engineering**  
Architecting APIs and backend services with Node.js and Python. Experience ranges from monolithic applications to distributed microservices, with emphasis on database optimization and system reliability.

**Mobile Application Development**  
Building Android applications using Java and Kotlin with Room Database for local persistence. Also develop cross-platform solutions with React Native when unified codebases make sense.

**Data Layer & Infrastructure**  
Designing database schemas and query optimization across MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Deploy and maintain cloud infrastructure on AWS, including serverless architectures for cost-efficient scaling.

**What Drives Me:**  
Solving complex technical problems with simple, elegant solutions. Whether optimizing a slow database query or architecting a new system from scratch, I believe the best code is code that's easy to understand and modify.
